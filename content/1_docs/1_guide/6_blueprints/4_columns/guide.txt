Title: Columns

----

Intro: Columns structure the layout of your form according to the prominence each part of the form should get.

----
Text:

A blueprint's layout is created with columns of different widths.

Columns can have the following widths:
`1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, `2/3`, `2/4`, `3/4`

You can have single or multi-column layouts as required, for example to create typical main column/sidebar layouts, or equal width columns.

Columns can contain one or more sections or just a set of fields.

They can be used as the top level of your blueprint or inside (link: docs/guide/blueprints/tabs text: tabs) to give structure to each individual tab.


## Defining columns

Columns can be defined in two ways:

### Named columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  left:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  right:
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

<info>
If you want to extend columns, you have to use named columns.

### Unnamed columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  - width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  - width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

## Sticky columns

You can make an entire column sticky. This can be handy for a setup with a smaller sidebar that should always be available, even when you scroll.

```yaml
columns:
  - width: 1/3
    sticky: true
    sections:
      # sections in the sticky column
```
