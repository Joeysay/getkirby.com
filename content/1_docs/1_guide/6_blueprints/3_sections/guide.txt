Title: Sections

----

Intro: Sections help you to organize content in the Panel or provide additional information or functionality. Kirby comes with 4 default section types.

Text:

Sections structure your forms with subpages, files, fields or additional information. **As purely structural elements they do not store anything in the content files**. Therefore, sections are not addressed in templates or snippets.  

## Where section can be used

Section can be used in all types of blueprints: (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/page text: page blueprints), (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file text: file blueprints), the (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/site text: site blueprint) and (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/user text: user blueprints). They can be used as the top level of your blueprints or inside (link: docs/guide/blueprints/columns text: columns) and (link: docs/guide/blueprints/tabs text: tabs).

Single sections can also be defined as section blueprints (by convention in `/site/blueprints/sections`) and be (link: docs/guide/blueprints/extending-blueprints text: reused across multiple blueprints).

## Section types

Kirby comes with the following four section types:

### Fields section

A fields section consists of any number of (link: docs/guide/blueprints/fields text: form fields).

<info>
Field names in different sections within the same blueprint must have unique names.
</info>

### Files section

The purpose of a files section is to list, upload, delete and replace files. The files in a files section always have a single parent page.

To separate different file types, you can assign a (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file text: file template) to a section.

### Info section

An info section can be used to provide helpful information to editors in a blueprint at the section level, while an (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/info text: `info` field) does the same at the field level. Their look and feel is the same, the only difference is where they can be used.

### Pages section

The purpose of a pages section is to list, create, delete and publish/unpublish pages. The pages in a pages section always have a single parent page. They can be filtered by template and status.

You can create your own custom sections that either extend the functionality of the default sections or provide completely custom functionality.
